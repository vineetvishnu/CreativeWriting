I will remember the date as on this day my first dose of vaccine would be given.There were utterly dejected feelings running through my mind as I thought whether these vaccines really decrease the chances of virus from entering our body or will it make it more prone to that virus. “Damm the virus” I yelled while putting on my clothes and set out to the hospital with none other than my mother. “Maa,stand here” as we finally came to the last man of this never-ending line. The Sun showed his wickedness as many people in the queue found a shade to stand to prevail from the unbearable heat. At the stroke of afternoon, we made our way inside the hospital and completed all the payments, received the coupon and went straight to ward no.115 where the vaccines were furnished. “Babin, do not get afraid by the sight of the vaccine,ok?” <br> “Please ma , say this to yourself “, as i saw her grasp my hand before entering the room.My mom had made all her plans in order to get rid of the fear of injecting the vaccine. She straightway started gossiping with the nurse while she put the vaccine in my left arm. It was like an ant bite,tbh. My mother ,at this time, swayed the nurse in such a way that they seemed more like college friends.Thus , at the end,my mother enjoyed the course of injecting a vaccine in her hand and we blithely  went out of the room. But….Butttttt trust me the ant bite i felt at that moment grew into something more devastating for the next two days. Anyways, I do not want to frighten anyone.<br> This is the small experience that I shared with you all and I request everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

The sight was alluring and hence I ventured, looking at it through rosy glasses. As I walked on, the path transformed into a serpentine form and when I glanced around I saw the devil sneering at my lack of astuteness and choice. I stood there confused and helpless praying with eyes wide open for a will and way to appear from the blue, but when everything was stagnant, I decided to make my own. For what seemed like ages, I scampered around searching for a path out of that dreaded maze. Tired, I gave up on that obsolete desire and finally lay prostrate on the ground. As dawn cracked the sky, I knew that what I was searching for all this while was within me. Elated, I closed my eyes and the maze disappeared on its own.<br> When you trust on intuition and nurture faith, you will see that what you desire is truly possible.<br>As coined by Elbert Hubbard, when life gives you lemons, make a lemonade.<br><br>-Oshmita')"></li>

Love as a word:<br><br>As far as love as a word is concerned it is eternal happiness and a beauty of the explanation of a feeling that cannot be even expressed in words . It is a self explanatory and divine word .The perspective of human nature that we are emotional animals has a great significance with the word love as it is the perfect explanation of creation to death of a living organism including its emotion and the passion and beauty with which the god has created us and the love which our parents , friends and alma maters has given us .<br><br><br>2.  Love as a Emotion:<br><br>The most powerful and attractive emotion made by the god to bind the world together is <b>LOVE</b>. Love is not  a emotion it is the feeling of god for the creations made by it and the explanatory of divinity and the way to be a real god in the foem of human being.Those people who have attained the utmost respect and a place in everyone heart has been known for their knowledge which they got by <b>love</b>.An unexplaned feature of every thing created by the biggest artist in the world is <b>LOVE</b>.<br><br><br>3.

This moment we are dreaming about our childhood days, the next moment we are in the thoughts about the extreme possibilities of our lives. According to Shakespeare, the world is a stage and all the men and women are merely players, by this he means that in our life we play different parts and what matters is that how we play it. The kind of thoughts we have decides the kind of life we would live. For a person who sees himself in the mirror, never ever thinks about the negative features of his face but those features are brought to light by the people around him. The face is ours; the mirror is ours and how we project ourselves is what matters. Thus, we should not be influenced by what other people think about us because we cannot change their mindset but instead learn to ignore such advances. The life which we possess, might be kept to ourselves or handed over to others, is our choice. Whether we stay melancholic or find happiness even in our sorrows, the understanding is ours. The direction in which the wheel of our life should move is also a solitary decision. The painting of our lives is our own creation and reflect our personal interpretation of it. What colors put in shows how life appears to us. We have the colors, we have the paper, how much color we put and where we put, the choice is also ours. Thus, Helen Keller has rightly stated -  “When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us”..<br><br>-SANIKA GANGULY')"></li>
